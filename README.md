# socket-hangman
This is a game that allows two parties to engage in a game of hangman. There will be two clients and one server. The job of the server is to facilitate the game of hangman and processes and relay input from one client to the next. This game of hangman is just like the real one; there is a guesser and someone who comes up with the word to be guessed (lets call that person the executioner). Because a machine is involved I predict the game could be done in varying ways. Here are some:      • The server could always be the executioner and allow both clients to take turns guessing     • One client could be the executioner and another be the guesser     • For some strange reason.. one client can be the executioner and both the server and remaining client take turns guessing.  The other game logic is up to the developers who may seek guidance from the PM.
